Some config for various software that I use on various machines.

## Requirement
 
Install [nvchad](https://nvchad.com/quickstart/install#pre-requisites) with it requierements (neovim 0.7.2 or above, nerd font, ripgrep)

## List of software with config

- neovim (nvchad custom config) run :PackerSync and :MasonInstall after install.

## Quick start

Simply run `./install.sh` to run the install scripts inside each directory inside `config/`. Those scripts will copy the configurations to the appropriate location on the newmachine. Optionnally scripts can install and clean stuff so be careful and read it they are dummy.
